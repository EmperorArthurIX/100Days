# 100 Days of Code

The repository where I shall be uploading all the stuff I learn during the 100 days of code challenge I have taken up on February 1st, 2022.

## Inspiration

I have learnt C, C++, Java and Python, but I never really practiced data structures and algorithms rigorously. I am now correcting this mistake before it is too late and am going to focus on as many fundamental algorithms as possible here.

My aim is to understand algorithms in Python, which I plan to make my primary development language. Maybe some recruiter will see my efforts and give me a job, who knows ;)
